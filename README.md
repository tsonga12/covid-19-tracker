## Covid-19 tracker
### Features
- Display the active, recovered and death cases based on selected country
- Line chart displays total cases of the selected country filtered by all time or 30 days or 7 days
- Country Map indicates the severity of each state/province in the selected country (since the the library I used does not have the real data of each province/state so I faked it by using its index to be the number of cases of each province/state)
